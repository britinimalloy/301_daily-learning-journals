# LJ Code 301 - Day 3
### (Wednesday 13July2017)

Today was hectic again, there's so much work...and between possibly merging master into a branch instead of vice versa, or updates just completely screwing up my computer, I had even less time to attempt to get the portfolio done. I think Code Fellows needs to have a barracks to go along with the boot camp...maybe I'd get more work done. My brain now seems perma-mush, although we shared a lot of the work today so I actually had some ideas. Yay! Time to finish reading, do a post, then attempt to sleep.
