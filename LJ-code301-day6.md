# LJ Code 301 - Day 6
### (Tuesday 18July2017)

Today I learned a bit about Node.js. I had previously heard about Node.js but never learned exactly what it is. I did find it interesting that JavaScript can and is now used to backend stuff, I had previously heard it was a client side things because other languages like Java, C#, and even PHP were better used for backend because they have more functionality. JavaScript, being fast, was better used for client-side, frontend stuff. Node.js has made that not so true. I am also amazed at the list of companies using Node.js, particularly because Microsoft has C#. I am, however, unclear on this single thread, non-blocking...I have no idea what that is.
