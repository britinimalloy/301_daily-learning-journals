# LJ Code 301 - Day 1
### (Monday 11July2017)

Today (yesterday) I learned that jQuery, once you get the syntax down, is much easier and possibly more powerful than JavaScript. Where things were often complicated or convoluted with JavaScript, jQuery is not so. I also realized that as long as it's not a big, long project, I can still work with some people. I am looking forward to learning more in this class, and hopefully struggling less. Or at least not so much with having to do resubmits so I can finish my work.
