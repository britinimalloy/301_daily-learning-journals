# LJ Code 301 - Day 3
### (Monday 17July2017)

Today I learned that code wars is nowhere near as complicated as I thought! I was working (infuriatingly) in rank up instead of fundamentals so I was working on much more complex problems than I needed to be working on.

I also learned a new thing relating to check boxes, today's was specifically about the date for the day 5 pair programming lab. I learned that you can check if a box is checked, it is then you can grab today's date using the new Date () and if it's not checked you can set the value to null. Thanks James!

We also got into AJAX, I think I got the concept but hopefully we will keep using it so I don't lose what understanding I think I have.
