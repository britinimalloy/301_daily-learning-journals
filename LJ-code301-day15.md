# LJ Code 301 - Day 15
### (Friday 28July2017)

Today, or rather this weekend, I learned that even with hard work and determination you can fall short. I started out Saturday morning trying to get the quizzes, both the required one and the "ungraded" one done since they would be prep for the exam I needed to take. I had hoped to get that out of the way early so it could take some weight off my shoulders. By the time I satisfactorily finished both, I had a migraine so bad I could barely see my screen. I decided it was a good time to break and take some meds to calm my head. It helped, but when I went to take the exam, it did not go well. Some of the questions seemed familiar from 201, but I swear the correct answers from then were not correct now. Or maybe my head was still way more fuzzy than I thought. At any rate, I felt like crap after failing the exam, sure I would just get pulled out of class this morning and sent packing. Then I realized if that was going to happen it would likely be at the end of the week, after I'd wasted the whole week still working and thinking I was OK and not on the chopping block, just so my team wouldn't be burdened. I also realized, too late, that I'd forgotten to notate that the inspiration for my attempt at redoing portfolio 6, with the AJAX stuff, was inspired by the started code from lab 7. Funny enough, I could not find an "AJAX" call actually in it, which is funny because it was after we did the AJAX stuff so why wouldn't it be in there? At any rate, by the time I got to that lab I was so tired and dejected I didn't really have time to keep searching through tens of files from tens of folders. I had a rough time trying to get 3 and 4 to work, and I did get a bit of help from Aeone but everyone else was very quiet. Busy on their own stuff, understandably. I never did hear back from Erica on meeting outside of school hours, this weekend would have been difficult to go somewhere, but if it was one-on-one time, I would have died trying.
