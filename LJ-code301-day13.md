# LJ Code 301 - Day 13
### (Wednesday/Thursday 26/27July2017)

Today I learned that Google spent a lot of money trying to figure out the "perfect" team. I seems like they found there is no such thing, but they did find ways to go about making groups better. I think this industry, as a whole, is a tough-to-share-feelings kind of group, but hopefully that's changing. And hopefully our program is part of that. For the most part we seem to be working together well and socializing, some of the foundational things that make a team better. I am also looking forward to being done with all this lecture, portfolio, and pair assignments. I go back and forth between feeling like I'm drowning and feeling like I can do this...I think this class it's more the workload than concepts, as opposed to the last class. I sort of understood the concepts last time, as now, but implementing them was even slower (although there was less pair stuff so I'd be in trouble without that but the same workload). This class the main problem is the workload.
