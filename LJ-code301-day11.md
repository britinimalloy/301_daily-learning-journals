# LJ Code 301 - Day 11
### (Monday/Tuesday 24/25July2017)

Today I learned that when running a project on localhost I can hit f5 to refresh the page. I also learned that the other 301 class does things a bit differently, it seems they do their pair programming assignments in the morning, or at least that's the impression we got. Even though the lecture ended a bit early today, there was a fair amount of spinning our wheels trying to get an understanding of what exactly we needed to do. Everyone seemed to have some issues. I am still, at the end of the day, feeling a bit lost on the point of why we're doing what we're doing. I also don't know if, with everything else we have to do and the deadlines, if I will make it through resubmits for my portfolio assignments. I haven't been able to get hold of Erica to work on things outside of school hours, I'm feeling a bit burned out and I'm once again wondering if all this work and sacrifice is good enough to move successfully past this class and on to the next. It's tiring just to think about how much is left...I'm starting to feel like this is pointless...
