# LJ Code 301 - Day 8
### (Wednesday/Thursday 19/20July2017)

Today I learned about normalization and inner joins. OK, I didn't LEARN so much as I reviewed. If I had not had my headphones on and missed the discussion behind me, I might have been able to teach someone else about what the ON part of the inner joins. I have done this before so the wording of the reading made sense to me, but looking back I see now that it was rather vague as to what should go in that part.
