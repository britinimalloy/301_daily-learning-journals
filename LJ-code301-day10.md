# LJ Code 301 - Day 10
### (Friday 21July2017)

Today (this weekend) I learned I really can do this on my own, now I just have to remember that. Redoing bussmall during the break was helpful, but my brain did recall how I'd previously done things and so it wasn't COMPLETELY from scratch. The planning and diagrams I did were, but the code was still kind of there. Doing codewars, however, especially over the weekend with nobody there to help me when I get stuck is a different story. They are small problems, so there isn't much to them, but I'm doing it all on my own. I'm still slower than I'd like, but for me it takes a lot of repetition doing a lot of these things before they really start to sink in and I can recall things without having to look them up. It will probably just take me time to really get into the swing and remember how to do things. Besides, Dawn from the lunch-and-learn on Friday said she had to look things up for years before they even started mob programming and she found that even experienced people had to look things up. So sit down and shut up, impostor monkey! Or better yet, go away! I got this! I just have to let that show more so that even where I lack, until I sharpen my skills, I can show I make up for it by working my butt off to get it done anyway! So what if I'm slower than others, I'll still get there!! Slow and steady wins the race! Go eat your banana in the corner...leave me alone!
